And that's not all - you can install third-party keyboards and use them instead. Some keyboards feature alternate key layouts, additional emoji, or even "swipe" style input where you slide your finger around the keyboard instead of tapping specific keys.

How to use a new keyboard on an iPhone after you've changed to it
Start an app that you can type in, like Messages or Mail. You should see a new button shaped like a globe at the bottom left of the screen. You can use the button in two ways:

Tap it. Every time you tap the button, it will cycle you through the available keyboards, from the default to Emoji, to the newly added keyboard, back to the default, and so on.
Tap and hold. If you tap and hold the globe, you'll see a pop-up menu from which you can choose the keyboard you want to use with a tap.

How to change your default keyboard on an iPhone

1. Start the Settings app.

2. Tap "General." Then tap "Keyboard."

3. Tap "Keyboards."

4. On the Keyboard page, tap "Edit."

5. Rearrange the order of the keyboards. You can drag them using the "handles" - the three horizontal lines - on the right side of the screen. Drag the one you want to be the default to the top of the list.
